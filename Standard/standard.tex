\textit{This document describes LabSpace, a collaborative space where students, professors, professionals and enthusiasts can exchange knowledge and experiences on a wide variety of areas including, but not limited to engineering, business, economics and art. The operational model and other implementation related details are discussed and analyzed to allow for an easy and quick adoption by any interested academic organization.}

\section*{Introduction}
LabSpace is a specially engineered maker-space \cite{whatsamakerspace} targeting the academic environment where students, professors, professionals and other enthusiasts can meet and exchange theoretical and practical knowledge around a multitude of areas of interest (engineering, business, economics, art etc.). The main vision of LabSpace is to promote the exchange of knowledge and ideas between interdisciplinary teams, sparking innovation and allowing people to make an impact through their abilities. Mentoring, coaching as well as teaching relationships are also encouraged among LabSpace's members.

Figure \ref{fig:ls_env} shows LabSpace inside its preferred context. Preferred context is defined as the ideal environment into which LabSpace is expected to acomplish it's goals in an efficient and sustainable manner. It is beneficial here to explain each of the components in more detail. The \textit{implementing academic organization} is the academic organization (i.e. the university or school) that hosts LabSpace into its premises. The \textit{socioeconomic environment} is the society and the economy into which the \textit{implementing academic organization} operates in. In other words, this block models the country the \textit{implementing academic organization} is in, along with all of its social and financial forces that affect the operation of the latter. The \textit{corporations} denote the commercial organizations that are active in that particular \textit{socioeconomic environment}. Finally, the \textit{other academic organizations} block defines other universities or schools that although they are not implementing LabSpace, they contribute to an already existing implementation sharing people and other resources (see \ref{sec:equipment}). The actors in Figure \ref{fig:ls_env} define the roles different people play in the different environments inside and outside of LabSpace. 
The different roles outside of LabSpace are explained below:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textit{Professor}. The person that is employed as a professor in either the \textit{implementing academic organization} or any \textit{other academic organization}.
    \item \textit{Researcher}. The person that is employed as a researcher in either the \textit{implementing academic organization} or any \textit{other academic organization}.
    \item \textit{Student}. The person that is studying at either the \textit{implementing academic organization} or any \textit{other academic organization}.
    \item \textit{Professional}. The person that is employed by one or more \textit{corporations} (see definition above) and is either representing his/her organization or is contributing to LabSpace as an individual.
    \item \textit{Enthusiast}. The person that belongs to none of the above categories, but still contributes to LabSpace.
\end{itemize}

All of the above roles when active inside of LabSpace, turn into one (or multiple) of the following:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textit{Spacer}. The person that is learning and enhancing his/her skills inside LabSpace by participating to projects or being mentored, coached or teached by others.
    \item \textit{Mentor}. The person that is mentoring one or more spacers inside of LabSpace.
    \item \textit{Coach}. The person that is coaching one or more spacers inside of LabSpace.
    \item \textit{Teacher}. The person that is teaching one or more spacers inside of LabSpace.
\end{itemize}

Observing LabSpace from a different perspective, we could see it as a transformation of roles. Inside of LabSpace it doesn't matter if you are a professor or a student, both can teach and both should be open to learning from anybody regardless of the roles they posses outside of LabSpace. It is a neutral zone from the knowledge perspective.

From the discussion above, we can easily identify the different stakeholders in LabSpace's environment. These are the \textit{implementing academic organization}, the \textit{corporations}, the \textit{other academic organizations} and the individual \textit{professionals} and \textit{enthusiasts} that are active in a LabSpace.

% The operation section discusses the operational model of LabSpace and how an interested academic organization can go about implementing it.
\section{Operation}

\subsection{LabSpace Business Model}
\textit{How will LabSpace be self sustainable? Which are going to be it's partners and the key activities that need to be undertaken in order for it to operate properly? What are the costs (if any) and how are they going to be covered (the less the financial impact on the university the better)?}

\subsection{Space Layout}
\textit{This is specific to the Electrum lab. It consists of a top view of the lab where the placement of available resources (i.e. teables, PCs, other equipment) is shown. The goal is  to allow for  easy concurrent access for the maximum number of students.}

\subsection{Equipment}
\label{sec:equipment}
\textit{The minimum required equipment for operation will be discussed here and a list specifically for Electrum can be created.}

\subsection{Space Management}
\textit{The "fair use" policy will be defined here to ensure that the space can be used by anyone, but also specific resources can be bound for future use (e.g. breadboards and components to avoid assembly and disassembly of the circuit on every visit). Access to the building will be discussed here.}\cite{mobilehealth}

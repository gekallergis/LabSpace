LabSpace
========

LabSpace is a specially engineered maker-space where students and other enthusiasts can meet and exchange knowledge and experiences around different engineering related matters as well as non-engineering ones (i.e. art). The main vision of LabSpace is to promote the exchange of ideas between interdisciplinary teams and give birth to innovative projects that combine knowledge from a multitude of different areas. Knowledge exchange is also encouraged inside of LabSpace allowing for members to enhance their skills and also get a chance to help (or get helped by) others in order to overcome possible learning difficulties they might be experiencing.
